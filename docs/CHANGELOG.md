## ðŸ“ˆ Changelog

### Version 0.5.1 (2024-11-05)
  - Testing out use of timestamps for setting range.
  
### Version 0.5.1 (2024-11-04)
  - Fixed an issue where if no filters were added, decoder would not run properly.

### Version 0.5.0 (2024-11-03)
  - Some Major Refactoring and changes made.
    - Parsed and created `Filter` classes for every (video) Ffmpeg filter.
      - Filters defined within `Celux.pyi`
        - Not all are tested. For Full documentation of arguments and usage, see: [ffmpeg-filter-docs](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html)
        - Please create a new issue if any problems occur!
    - Fixed an issue with Filter initialization and unwanted output messages. 
    ```py
    from celux import VideoReader, Scale #, CreateFilter, FilterType


    scale_filter = Scale(width = "1920", height = "1080")

    # scale_filter = CreateFilter(FilterType.Scale)
    # scale_filter.setWidth("1920")
    # scale_filter.setHeight"1080")
    # scale_filter.setFlags("bicubic")

    with VideoReader("input.mp4", device = "cpu", filters = [scale_filter]) as reader:
      for frame in reader:
        # will be a scaled frame
    ```


### Version 0.4.5.5 (2024-10-30)
  - Added some safety checks for filters.
    - Fixed issue that occurs when using `scale`.

### Version 0.4.5 (2024-10-29)
  - Implemented filters for `cpu` usage. 
    - usage should be familiar to those who've used `ffmpeg`:
  ```py  
  filters = [("scale", "1280:720"), ("hue", "0.5")]
  reader = cx.VideoReader("/path/to/input", device = "cpu", filters = filters)
  ```

### Version 0.4.4 (2024-10-29)
  - Removed Stream Parameter in `VideoReader`: The `VideoReader` no longer accepts an external CUDA stream. 
  - Introduced event-based synchronization between frame reading operations to ensure proper and consistent output.
  - Use of `nvdec` directly.

### Version 0.4.3.5 (2024-10-29)
  - Testing some changes, partial release, may end up reverting.
  - Use `nvdec` directly instead of `_cuvid`.
  - Some small refactoring and testing, nothing major.


### Version 0.4.3 (2024-10-29)
- **New Features**:
  - Added `num_threads` arg to control decoder threads internally used. 
  - Fixed `VideoReader()` calls, now properly sets frame range.
  - *Potentially* fixed issue with cuda synchronizations. 

### Version 0.4.2 (2024-10-28)
- **Focus on `VideoReader`**:
  - Removed `VideoWriter` to streamline the library and enhance focus on reading capabilities.
  - Fixed call method of `VideoReader`, now properly seeks frames.

- **New Features**:
  - Added `__getitem__` method to `VideoReader` for easier access to properties, allowing users to retrieve metadata using dictionary-like syntax (e.g., `reader['width']`).
  - Expanded `VideoReader.get_properties()` to include new metadata properties:
    - `codec`: **The name of the codec being used.**
    - `bit_depth`: **The bit-depth of the video.**
    - `has_audio`: **Indicates whether the video contains an audio track.**
    - `audio_bitrate`: **Bitrate of the audio stream.**
    - `audio_channels`: **Number of audio channels.**
    - `audio_sample_rate`: **Sample rate of the audio stream.**
    - `audio_codec`: **Codec used for audio.**
    - `min_fps`: **Minimum frames per second of the video.**
    - `max_fps`: **Maximum frames per second of the video.**
    - `aspect_ratio`: **Aspect ratio of the video.**
    
- **New Converter Formats**:
  - Completed the implementation of the following converters to support new video formats:
    - YUV420P to RGB
    - YUV420P10LE to RGB48
    - BGR to RGB
    - RGB to RGB
    - P010LE to RGB48

- **Supported Codecs**:
  - The following codecs can be worked with using the `VideoReader`, based on supported pixel formats:
    - **H.264 (AVC)**: YUV420P, YUV420P10LE
    - **H.265 (HEVC)**: YUV420P, YUV420P10LE
    - **VP8/VP9**: YUV420P, YUV420P10LE
    - **AV1**: YUV420P, YUV420P10LE
    - **MPEG-2**: YUV420P
    - **ProRes**: YUV420P, YUV422, YUV444
    - **DNxHD/DNxHR**: YUV422, YUV444
    - **DV (Digital Video)**: YUV420P
    - **Uncompressed RGB**: RGB, BGR
    - **P010LE**: P010LE

- **Testing Improvements**:
  - Updated tests to ensure compatibility with various bit-depths and codec types.
  - Added tests to verify the correct functionality of the new features and converters.
